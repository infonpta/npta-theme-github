They reassured me that as long as I’m okay with learning and allowed myself to absorb information like a sponge then everything will get better with practice and time. As Jesse said ‘you have to get your reps in, just like exercising yourself, you’ll only make progress with consistency and practice’\nI took those words to heart and practiced. A lot. I made sure to take my notes and get to know the ins and outs of the facility and system they have in place, and even to this day I’m continuing with my learning experience. Through Jesse’s guidance and the team’s support I gained the confidence and pride to become certified and properly train others.\nAfter that the opportunities began flooding in. I started gaining more responsibilities around the facility, while running the community class every Saturday and now volunteering to work with the giving truck to help those in need.\nMy experience with Jesse and the rest of FITIN has and is still unbelievably amazing. I never imagined I would be as blessed as I am today, and I still have so much more work to do. I’m thrilled and proud to be a member of this community and I’m grateful to have been given this chance to make a difference in so many lives.","review_stars":5}},"review_6U3P9L":{"type":"review","settings":{"author_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Marie-Rose.png","author_name":"Marie Rose","author_title":"NPTA APPRENTICE GRADUATE","review_text":"My entire fitness journey started with NPTA. I enrolled into the personal training certification program and with the comprehensive theory provided by I passed the exam my first try! Not having any experience training clients, I enrolled into the apprenticeship program in order to grow my confidence as a trainer and build my client base. The 8 week apprenticeship program gave me the skills I needed to train clients independently and build strong relationships with my clients. The owners at Fit Integrated saw my passion and offered me a job afterwards! I am fortunate to now be able to live in France, still keep my clients at Fit integrated as an online trainer, and continue to grow my fitness career in my new home.

I’m at a stage where all my clients are recurring and I can focus on continuing to build my relationships with my clients.
